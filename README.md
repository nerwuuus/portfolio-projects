# General information
This branch includes a selection of files/reports I made while completing Alex the Analyst's and Luke Barousse's Tableau and Power BI courses on YouTube.

## Power BI
These projects were a journey through key Power BI and Tableau features. I mastered:

-   **Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
-   **Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Median Yearly Salary` and `Job Count`.
-   **Core Charts:** Utilized **Column, Bar, Line,** and **Area Charts** to compare job counts and track trends over time.
-   **KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data.
-   **Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
-   **Interactive Reporting:**
    -   **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by Job Title.
    -   **Buttons & Bookmarks:** To create a seamless navigation experience.
    -   **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.



### 1st project
I developed this project to refresh and expand my Power BI skills. My final report features distinct colours, layouts, and charts compared to Alex the Analyst's version. 
To create this report, I utilised survey data provided by Alex The Analyst ('Power BI - Final Project.xlsx'). You can find the file for the dashboard in *Files*, named as *Power BI Survey Project.pbix*.

### 2nd project
I developed this project to further expand my Power BI knowledge. This report is split into two distinct pages to provide both a high-level summary and a detailed analysis. You can find the file for the dashboard in *Files*, named as *Power BI Data Jobs Dashboard.pbix*.<br><br>

## Tableau
For the Tableau Project, I developed a dashboard using 2016 Seattle Airbnb data. I used data set downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle
This project was my first project in Tableau, and I tried to follow every step presented. Please see the attached file 'Airbnb 2016 Dashboard Project.twb' and 'Tableau Project.xlsx'.
