This repository contains a Tableau project. This project was created at the end of 21-hour YouTube online course led by Baraa form the 'Data with Baraa' channel.


I learned:
- over 50 charts.
- Using calculated fields and parameters.
- Formatting numbers and visuals.
- Creating dashboards and stories.
- What are differences between discrete and continuous data types and how they affect on visuals creation.
- How to use containers to build dashboard's structure.

The final task was full of challenges. During the final project, I faced issues with, e.g., number formatting on the KPI Quantity chart and text formatting on the KPI Profit chart.
My goal was to learn how to create dashboard. It is not perfect.
