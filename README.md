This repository contains a Tableau project created at the end of a 21-hour YouTube course led by Baraa from the 'Data with Baraa' channel.


**What I learned:**
- Over 50 types of charts.
- How to use calculated fields and parameters.
- Formatting numbers and visuals.
- Creating dashboards and stories.
- The differences between discrete and continuous data types, and how they affect visual creation.
- How to use containers to structure a dashboard.


The final task was full of challenges. During the project, I encountered issues such as number formatting on the KPI Quantity chart and text formatting on the KPI Profit chart. My goal was to learn how to create a dashboard. Itâ€™s not perfect, but it represents my learning journey.
