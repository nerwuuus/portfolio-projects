This repository, "Reports-created-as-PMO-Specialist' contains a collection of Excel files created during my tenure as a PMO Specialist. 
These tools were developed to support project tracking, reporting, and data visualization, ensuring accurate and timely information for stakeholders.

**Reports are stored in separate branches.**
**Project manager names, project descriptions, and project names have been anonymized to protect sensitive information. PowerQuery connections were removed and are only available as screenshots (steps taken, number of queries).**

The repository includes, e.g., Excel reports with:
- Macros: Automated scripts to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
- Charts and Dashboards: Visual representations of data to facilitate quick insights and decision-making.
- PowerQuery Connections: Data connections and transformations to integrate and manipulate data from various sources seamlessly.
