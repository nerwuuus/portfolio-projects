This repository contains a collection of my portfolio projects, as well as Excel and Power BI reports created during my tenure as a PMO Specialist. 
While working as a PMO Specialist, I developed reports to support project tracking, reporting, and data visualisation, ensuring accurate and timely information for stakeholders.
