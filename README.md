# General information
This branch includes a selection of files/reports I made while completing Alex The Analyst's Bootcamp on YouTube. I focused on Tableau and Power BI. 


## Tableau

For the Tableau Project, I developed a dashboard using 2016 Seattle Airbnb data. I used data set downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle
This project was my first project in Tableau, and I tried to follow every step presented. Please see the attached file 'Airbnb 2016 Dashboard Project.twb' and 'Tableau Project.xlsx'.

## Power BI

I developed this project to refresh and expand my Power BI skills. My final report features distinct colours, layouts, and charts compared to Alex the Analyst's version. 
To create this report, I utilised survey data provided by Alex The Analyst ('Power BI - Final Project.xlsx'). Please see the attached file 'Power BI Survey Project.pbix'.
