This repository, Excel_reports, contains a collection of advanced Excel files created during my tenure as a PMO Specialist. 
These tools were developed to support project tracking, reporting, and data visualization, ensuring accurate and timely information for stakeholders. 

The repository includes Excel reports with:
- Macros: Automated scripts to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
- Charts and Dashboards: Visual representations of data to facilitate quick insights and decision-making.
- PowerQuery Connections: Data connections and transformations to integrate and manipulate data from various sources seamlessly. Data is sourced from ServiceNow reports, uploaded to SharePoint, and then combined using PowerQuery to visualize them in Excel.
