This repository contains a collection of my portfolio projects, as well as Excel and PowerBI reports created during my tenure as a PMO Specialist. 
While working as a PMO Specialist, reports were developed to support project tracking, reporting, and data visualization, ensuring accurate and timely information for stakeholders.


**Projects and reports are stored in separate branches. One branch = one project/one report**


**Project manager names, project descriptions, and project names have been anonymized to protect sensitive information. PowerQuery connections were removed and are only available as screenshots (steps taken, number of queries).**
